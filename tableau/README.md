## What I Learned

- Creating compelling visual stories using Tableau’s drag-and-drop interface.  
- Connecting to different data sources and preparing data for visualization.  
- Using calculated fields, filters, and parameters to enhance interactivity.

Feel free to explore the dashboards and reach out if you’d like to connect or collaborate!
