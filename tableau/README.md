# Tableau Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Tableau** projects where I create engaging and insightful data visualizations.

## Projects

- **Project 1: 🧑‍💼📈 HR Analytics - Understanding Workforce Dynamics**  
  Designed a comprehensive dashboard to support HR teams in making informed, data-driven decisions by providing clear insights into key workforce metrics..

- **Project 2: Yearly Sales**  
  Developed an interactive dashboard to monitor sales performance over a four-year period across multiple regions. Users can toggle between a high-level sales overview and a detailed table highlighting key metrics such as total sales, quantity sold, and profit per transaction.
