## üìå Key Insights
  ### 1) Employee Retention Analysis
  a) Who are the top 5 highest serving employees?
  ```sql
   SELECT 
   e.employee_id,
   e.department_id,
   e.first_name,
   e.last_name,
   e.hire_date,
   COALESCE(TO_CHAR(t.turnover_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Still employed') AS "Status"
   FROM employee e
   LEFT JOIN turnover t ON e.employee_id = t.employee_id
   LEFT JOIN department d ON t.department_id = d.department_id
   WHERE t.turnover_date IS NULL  
   ORDER BY e.hire_date
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

 b) What is the turnover rate for each department?
 ####
   This section looks at how many employees are leaving each department. A high turnover rate in a department could mean there are      issues like **poor work environment, low satisfaction, or lack of support**.
   
  I calculated the turnover rate using this formula:
   
            Turnover Rate (%) = (Number of Employees Who Left / Total Employees in Department) * 100

  ```sql
   SELECT 
		d.department_id, 
		d.department_name, 
        ROUND((CAST(COUNT(t.employee_id) AS DECIMAL) / COUNT(e.employee_id) * 100),2) AS "Turnover Rate"
	FROM department d
    JOIN employee e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
	LEFT JOIN turnover t ON e.employee_id = t.employee_id
	GROUP BY d.department_id, d.department_name;
   ```

**Key Insights**
- Marketing has the highest turnover rate at 92.86%, suggesting a possible issue with retention in that department.
- Engineering also shows a relatively high turnover rate of 66.67%, which may warrant further investigation.
- Sales and HR have significantly lower turnover rates at 27.59% and 27.27% respectively, indicating better employee stability in those areas.

c) Which employees are at risk of leaving based on their performance?
 ####
   Employees with consistently low or declining performance and engagement are more likely to leave. Identifying them early allows    management to offer support and improve retention.
   
  ```sql
   SELECT e.employee_id, 
		   e.first_name,
		   e.last_name,
		   p.performance_score,
		   t.turnover_date
	FROM employee e
   LEFT JOIN performance p ON e.employee_id = p.employee_id
   LEFT JOIN turnover t ON e.employee_id = t.employee_id
   WHERE  p.performance_score <= 3.5 AND turnover_date IS NULL -- they still work at the company
   ORDER BY p.performance_score ASC;
   ```

d) What are the main reasons employees are leaving the company?
 ####
   Employees often leave due to factors like lack of growth opportunities, poor management, inadequate compensation, work-life          imbalance, and low job satisfaction. Identifying these causes helps the company address issues and improve retention.
   
  ```sql
   SELECT reason_for_leaving,
	COUNT(employee_id) AS "Total Leave"
	FROM turnover
	GROUP BY reason_for_leaving
	ORDER BY "Total Leave" DESC;
   ```
