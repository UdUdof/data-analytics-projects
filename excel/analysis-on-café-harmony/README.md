## 💡 Insights & Recommendations

- There should also be marketing campaigns to target best-selling items and its menu should be tailored to promote the top items for each location.
- Café Harmony should focus its promotions like discounts on adults as they spend the most. As seniors are the least likely to spend money, the café should ensure seating/environment is comfortable, adjusted menu to suit dietary needs, and tech support.
- To improve its stock management, Café Harmony should restock based on sales/location demands. Stock levels should be monitored.
- To ensure that employees & branches are meeting targets, the café should monitor low performances, provide additional training, allocate resources, and rewards to boost morale
