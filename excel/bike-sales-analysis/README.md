# 🚴🏽Bike Sales Analysis (Excel)

This project explores customer demographics and purchasing behavior using Excel. I analyzed a bike sales dataset and developed an interactive dashboard to surface insights related to income, age, gender, commute distance, and purchase trends.

## 📊 Project Objective

To identify key patterns in customer data that influence bike purchases, and present these insights through a clean, interactive Excel dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.

## 🧩 Key Insights Visualized

- **Average Income by Gender & Purchase Decision**  
  Customers who purchased bikes generally had higher income across both genders, especially male buyers.

- **Age Bracket Trends**  
  The majority of bike purchases came from customers in the *Middle Age* bracket, with fewer purchases among adolescents and older customers.

- **Commute Distance & Bike Purchase**  
  Shorter commute distances (especially 0–1 miles) showed higher bike purchase rates compared to longer commutes.
